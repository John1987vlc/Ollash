Okay, the `config/settings.json` file has been updated to use `http://192.168.1.217:11434` as the Ollama URL and `nemotron-3-nano:30b` as the `summary_model`.

**Before running the benchmark, please ensure that the following models are pulled into your Ollama instance running at `192.168.1.217:11434`:**

*   `devstral-small-2:latest`
*   `gpt-oss:20b`
*   `qwen3-coder:30b`
*   `nemotron-3-nano:30b`

You can pull these models by running the following commands on the machine where your Ollama instance is running (not inside the Docker container):

```bash
ollama pull devstral-small-2:latest
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
ollama pull qwen3-coder:30b
ollama pull nemotron-3-nano:30b
```

**Once the models are pulled, you can run the Dockerized benchmark using the following command:**

```bash
docker-compose run --rm moltbot python benchmark.py --models devstral-small-2:latest gpt-oss:20b qwen3-coder:30b
```

This command will:
*   Start a temporary `moltbot` container.
*   The `moltbot` container will use the `config/settings.json` which now points to your external Ollama at `192.168.1.217:11434`.
*   It will run `benchmark.py` testing `devstral-small-2:latest`, `gpt-oss:20b`, and `qwen3-coder:30b`.
*   The summary will be generated using `nemotron-3-nano:30b`.
*   The benchmark results (JSON file) will be saved in your host's project root directory.

Let me know if you have any issues!
