Okay, you'd like to run the benchmark with these three models.

Before we proceed, I need a clarification regarding the Ollama instance you intend to use:

1.  **Are you using the Dockerized Ollama service that we just set up** (which is accessible from the `moltbot` container at `http://ollama:11434`)? In this case, the `config/settings.json` is already correctly configured.
2.  **Or do you intend to use an Ollama instance running directly on your host machine at `http://192.168.1.217:11434`**? If so, we would need to temporarily adjust the `ollama_url` in `config/settings.json` or override it via an environment variable when running the Docker container.

Please clarify which Ollama instance you want to benchmark against.

**Regardless of the Ollama location, please ensure these models are pulled into your Ollama instance:**
*   `devstral-small-2:latest`
*   `gpt-oss:20b`
*   `qwen3-coder:30b`

You can do this by running (assuming your Ollama server is running):
```bash
ollama pull devstral-small-2:latest
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
ollama pull qwen3-coder:30b
```

Once you clarify the Ollama instance, I can provide the exact command to run the benchmark.
