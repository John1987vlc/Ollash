# Ollash - Local IT Agent

**Ollash** is an advanced AI-powered IT assistant designed to run locally using Ollama. It orchestrates specialized agents to handle coding, system administration, cybersecurity, and network tasks autonomously.

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous Project Generation**: From concept to full codebase (frontend, backend, tests) with self-reflection.
*   **Specialist Swarm**: 5 specialized agents (Orchestrator, Coder, SysAdmin, NetSec, Reviewer) working in concert.
*   **Semantic Integrity**: Advanced JavaScript validation and logical consistency checks.
*   **Multimodal Interface**: Voice commands and OCR text extraction.
*   **Visual Intelligence**:
    *   **Brain View**: Explore decision history and knowledge graphs visually.
    *   **Time Machine**: Checkpoint timeline for project restoration.
    *   **Pair Programming**: Split-view editor with AI ghostwriter.
*   **Advanced Tooling**:
    *   **Floating Terminal**: Integrated Xterm.js console with autocomplete.
    *   **Visual Structure Editor**: Drag-and-drop project scaffolding.
    *   **Integrations Panel**: IFTTT-style automation triggers.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/ollash.git
    cd ollash
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    make setup
    ```

3.  **Configure environment:**
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your `OLLAMA_URL`.

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python run_web.py
    ```
    Access the UI at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (parallel, fast)
make test-unit

# Integration tests
make test-integration

# E2E Playwright tests (requires running server)
make test-e2e

# Full suite
make test

# Coverage report (generates htmlcov/index.html)
make coverage
```

## Code Quality

```bash
# Lint + format check
make lint

# Auto-fix formatting
make format

# Security scan (bandit + safety)
make security
```

## Architecture

Ollash uses a modular "Phase" architecture for its AutoAgent, allowing for flexible pipelines:
- **Analysis & Planning**: Requirements gathering and architecture design.
- **Generation**: Parallel code generation with CoT (Chain of Thought) verification.
- **Refinement & Repair**: Recursive self-correction loops.
- **Optimization**: Cross-file semantic consistency checks.

### v1.2.0 Frontend Architecture

The frontend has been refactored to a component-based architecture:

- **`frontend/static/js/core/store.js`** — Centralized pub/sub state management (replaces window globals).
- **`frontend/static/js/core/theme-manager.js`** — Dynamic dark/light theme switcher with CSS variable integration.
- **`frontend/static/js/components/`** — Reusable UI components: `modal-manager.js`, `confirm-dialog.js`, `notification-toast.js`.
- **`frontend/schemas/`** — Pydantic v2 request schemas for blueprint API validation.
- **`package.json` + `vite.config.js`** — Optional Vite bundling (activate with `USE_VITE_ASSETS=true` in `.env`).

### v1.2.1 Backend Modularization

`CoreAgent` was refactored from 768 to ~350 lines by extracting two new focused modules:

| New module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `backend/core/language_standards.py` | `frozenset` constants for Python stdlib, Node builtins, Go stdlib, and import-to-package mappings. Single source of truth shared by agents and scanners. |
| `backend/utils/core/analysis/scanners/dependency_reconciler.py` | `DependencyReconciler` — reconciles `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, and `Cargo.toml` with actual imports. Extracted from `CoreAgent`. |

`CoreAgent` now imports language constants from `language_standards` and delegates all reconciliation to `DependencyReconciler`, keeping the base class focused on its abstract agent contract.

**Bug fixes (CI/CD):**
- `JavaScriptOptimizationPhase`: added missing `await` on async `.chat()` calls (caused `TypeError` on Python 3.11).
- `JavascriptValidator`: extended poker-function regex to match ES6 class method syntax (`shuffle() {}`).`

### CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline runs jobs in parallel for minimal wall-clock time:

```
push / PR
  ├── lint          (parallel, immediate)
  ├── unit-tests    (parallel, immediate — matrix: py3.10 + py3.11)
  └── security      (parallel, immediate, informational)
        ↓ (when unit-tests passes)
        ├── integration-tests  (parallel)
        └── e2e-tests          (parallel)
```

Concurrent runs on the same branch are cancelled automatically.
