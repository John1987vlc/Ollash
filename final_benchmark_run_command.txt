Excellent! The Docker image for the `moltbot` agent has been built successfully.

Now, you can run the benchmark using the following command.

**Before running, please ensure that your external Ollama instance is actively running at `http://192.168.1.217:11434` and has all the required models pulled:**

*   `devstral-small-2:latest`
*   `gpt-oss:20b`
*   `qwen3-coder:30b`
*   `nemotron-3-nano:30b` (for summary generation)

**Command to run the Dockerized benchmark:**

```bash
docker-compose run --rm moltbot python benchmark.py --models devstral-small-2:latest gpt-oss:20b qwen3-coder:30b
```

This command will:
*   Start a temporary `moltbot` container.
*   The `moltbot` container will use the `config/settings.json` which points to your external Ollama at `http://192.168.1.217:11434`.
*   It will run `benchmark.py` testing `devstral-small-2:latest`, `gpt-oss:20b`, and `qwen3-coder:30b`.
*   The summary will be generated using `nemotron-3-nano:30b`.
*   The benchmark results (JSON file) will be saved in your host's project root directory.

Let me know if the benchmark runs successfully!
